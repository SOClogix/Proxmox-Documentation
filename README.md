# Proxmox Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for **Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE)** and **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)**.

This repository serves as the authoritative reference for the **installation**, **post-installation configuration**, **security hardening**, **best practices**, and **troubleshooting** of Proxmox infrastructure.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized, standardized, and security-focused body of documentation that enables SOClogix engineers to deploy, operate, secure, and support Proxmox VE and Proxmox Backup Server consistently and reliably.

Specifically, this documentation aims to:

- Standardize Proxmox deployments across all SOClogix environments  
- Define approved configuration and security baselines  
- Document hardening requirements aligned with SOClogix security standards  
- Capture best practices for performance, reliability, and scalability  
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) through clear troubleshooting guidance  

This repository is intended to be a **living document** and should evolve alongside Proxmox releases, infrastructure changes, and internal security requirements.

---

## Security Emphasis

All guidance is written with a defense-in-depth mindset and assumes operation in production, regulated, or security-sensitive environments.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Proxmox host hardening
- Secure access control and authentication
- Network segmentation and firewalling
- Backup integrity and encryption
- Auditability and logging considerations

All recommendations align with SOClogix internal security standards and SOC operational best practices.
